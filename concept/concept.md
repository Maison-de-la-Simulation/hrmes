# Concept note on the use of IA to accelerate spinup of OGCM

## Motivation

* an illustration of spin-up time from the QUEST project

Illustration of spin-up of IPSLCM6.2.2-MR025 (orange) and bifurcation towards another equilibrium (purple) after ocean currents were (mistakingly) reset to 0 ; other lines illustrate the long-term drift of IPSLCM6.2.2-MR1 (green and blue) and the bifurcation due to change in CO2 concentration (yellow and red) :
